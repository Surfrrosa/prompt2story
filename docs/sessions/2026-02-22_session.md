# Session: 2026-02-22

## Summary

Critical git hygiene cleanup. Removed accidentally committed node_modules (5,942 files, 2.5M lines) and .env files (containing API keys) from git tracking. Added project documentation and pinned all dependencies.

## What was done

### Security fix
- Removed `.env` and `frontend/.env` from git tracking (contained OpenAI API key)
- API key rotation required after this session

### Git hygiene
- Removed `node_modules/` from git tracking (5,942 files committed accidentally)
- Set `core.fileMode false` to prevent permission noise from external SSD filesystem
- Both `.gitignore` entries already existed — files were committed before the rules were added

### Documentation
- Created `CLAUDE.md` with project instructions, key files, domain rules, technical debt
- Created `docs/sessions/` directory with README and this session log

### Dependency pinning
- Pinned all 15 dependencies in root `package.json` to exact versions
- Pinned all 18 dependencies in `frontend/package.json` to exact versions
- Removed all `^` and `~` prefixes

## Commits
- `f1a5471` Remove node_modules and .env from git, add CLAUDE.md, pin deps

## Known issues
- OpenAI API key was exposed in git history — must be rotated
- `frontend/node_modules/` still scanned by maestro on disk (maestro bug, fix in progress separately)
- Dependencies score still 0/100 — needs investigation (3 unused, 16 phantom)
- Quality score 41/100 with 142 findings — likely from `frontend/node_modules/` on disk (maestro bug)

## Next tasks
- Rotate OpenAI API key
- Investigate unused/phantom dependency findings once maestro node_modules bug is fixed
- Consider splitting monolithic `App.tsx` (63KB)
